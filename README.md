arXiv preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18274

## Installation instructions

1. Agree to the Natural Scenes Dataset's [Terms and Conditions](https://cvnlab.slite.page/p/IB6BSeW_7o/Terms-and-Conditions) and fill out the [NSD Data Access form](https://forms.gle/xue2bCdM9LaFNMeb7)

2. Download this repository: ``git clone https://github.com/MedARC-AI/fMRI-reconstruction-NSD.git``

3. Run ``setup.sh`` to create a conda environment that contains the packages necessary to run our scripts; activate the environment with ``conda activate mindeye``.

```bash
cd fMRI-reconstruction-NSD/src
. setup.sh
```

4. (optional) For LAION-5B retrieval you will need to additionally download pretrained checkpoints. To do this, cd into the "src" folder and run ``. download.sh``. This will allow you to train the diffusion prior starting from a [pretrained checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/nousr/conditioned-prior/tree/main/vit-l-14/aesthetic) (text-to-image diffusion prior trained from LAION-Aesthetics). We observed that using this checkpoint, rather than training the prior from scratch, significantly improved LAION-5B retrieval.

# General information

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for 

1. Training MindEye (src/Train_MindEye.ipynb)
2. Reconstructing images from brain activity using the trained model (src/Reconstructions.ipynb)
3. Retrieving images from brain activity either from the test set or via LAION-5B (src/Retrievals.ipynb) 
4. Evaluating reconstructions against the ground truth images according to low- and high-level image metrics (src/Reconstruction_Metrics.ipynb) 

All the above Jupyter notebooks also have corresponding python (.py) files which can be run via the command-line.

This repo also contains code for mapping brain activity to the variational autoencoder of Stable Diffusion (src/train_autoencoder.py).

### Pre-trained Subject 1 models

You can skip training MindEye yourself and instead run the rest of the notebooks on Subject 1 of NSD by downloading our pre-trained models available on [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pscotti/naturalscenesdataset/tree/main/mindeye_models) and putting these folders containing model checkpoints inside "fMRI-reconstruction-NSD/train_logs/".

```
prior_257_final_subj01_bimixco_softclip_byol: CLIP ViT-L/14 hidden layer (257x768) 
prior_1x768_final_subj01_bimixco_softclip_byol: CLIP ViT-L/14 final layer (1x768)
autoencoder_subj01_4x_locont_no_reconst: Stable Diffusion VAE (low-level pipeline)
```

## Training MindEye (high-level pipeline)

Train MindEye via ``Train_MindEye.py``.

- Set ``data_path`` to the folder containing the Natural Scenes Dataset (will download there if not found; >30Gb per subject, only downloads data for the current subject).
- Set ``model_name`` to what you want to name the model, used for saving.
- Set ``--no-hidden --no-norm_embs`` if you want to map to the final layer of CLIP for LAION-5B retrieval or to reconstruct via Stable Diffusion (Image Variations). Otherwise, Versatile Diffusion uses the default ``--hidden --norm_embs``.

Various arguments can be set (see below) for training; the default is to train MindEye to the last hidden layer of CLIP ViT-L/14 using the same settings as our paper, for Subject 1 of NSD.

Trained model checkpoints will be saved inside a folder "fMRI-reconstruction-NSD/train_logs". All other outputs get saved inside "fMRI-reconstruction-NSD/src" folder.

## Reconstructing from pre-trained MindEye

Now that you have pre-trained model ckpts in your "train_logs" folder, either from running ``Train_MindEye.py`` or by downloading our pre-trained Subject 1 models from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pscotti/naturalscenesdataset/tree/main/mindeye_models), we can proceed to reconstructing images from the test set of held-out brain activity. 

``Reconstructions.py`` defaults to outputting Versatile Diffusion reconstructions as a torch .pt file, without img2img and without second-order selection (recons_per_sample=1).

- Set ``data_path`` to the folder containing the Natural Scenes Dataset (will download there if not found; >30Gb per subject, only downloads data for the current subject).
- Set ``model_name`` to the name of the folder contained in "fMRI-reconstruction-NSD/train_logs" that contains the ckpt mapping brain activity to the last hidden layer of CLIP.
- If you want to use img2img, set ``autoencoder_name`` to the name of the folder contained in "fMRI-reconstruction-NSD/train_logs" that contains the ckpt mapping brain activity to the variational autoencoder of Stable Diffusion. 
- If you are using img2img, set ``img2img_strength`` to the level of guidance you prefer, where 1=no img2img and 0=outputs solely from the low-level pipeline.

```bash
$ python Reconstructions.py --help
```
```
usage: Reconstructions.py [-h] [--model_name MODEL_NAME]
                          [--autoencoder_name AUTOENCODER_NAME] [--data_path DATA_PATH]
                          [--subj {1,2,5,7}] [--img2img_strength IMG2IMG_STRENGTH]
                          [--recons_per_sample RECONS_PER_SAMPLE]
                          [--vd_cache_dir VD_CACHE_DIR]

  --autoencoder_name AUTOENCODER_NAME
                        name of trained autoencoder model
  --data_path DATA_PATH
                        Path to where NSD data is stored (see README)
  --subj {1,2,5,7}
  --img2img_strength IMG2IMG_STRENGTH
                        How much img2img (1=no img2img; 0=outputting the low-level image
                        itself)
  --recons_per_sample RECONS_PER_SAMPLE
                        How many recons to output, to then automatically pick the best
                        one (MindEye uses 16)
  --vd_cache_dir VD_CACHE_DIR
                        Where is cached Versatile Diffusion model; if not cached will
                        download to this path
```

## Image/Brain Retrieval (inc. LAION-5B image retrieval)

To evaluate image/brain retrieval using the NSD test set then use the Jupyter notebook ``Retrievals.ipynb`` and follow the code blocks under the "Image/Brain Retrieval" heading.

Running ``Retrievals.py`` will retrieve the top 16 nearest neighbors in LAION-5B based on the MindEye variant where brain activity is mapped to the final layer of CLIP. This is followed by second-order selection where the 16 retrieved images are converted to CLIP last hidden layer embeddings and compared to the MindEye outputs from the core model where brain activity is mapped to the last hidden layer of CLIP. The highest CLIP similarity retrieved image will be chosen, with all top-1 retrievals saved to a torch .pt file.

- Set ``data_path`` to the folder containing the Natural Scenes Dataset (will download there if not found; >30Gb per subject, only downloads data for the current subject).
- Set ``model_name`` to the name of the folder contained in "fMRI-reconstruction-NSD/train_logs" that contains the ckpt mapping brain activity to the last hidden layer of CLIP.
- Set ``model_name2`` to the name of the folder contained in "fMRI-reconstruction-NSD/train_logs" that contains the ckpt mapping brain activity to the final layer of CLIP.

```bash
$ python Retrievals.py --help
```
```
usage: Retrievals.py [-h] [--model_name MODEL_NAME]
                               [--model_name2 MODEL_NAME2] [--data_path DATA_PATH]

  --subj {1,2,5,7}
```


## Evaluating Reconstructions

After you have saved a .pt file from running ``Reconstructions.py`` or ``Retrievals.py``, you can use ``Reconstruction_Metrics.py`` to evaluate reconstructed images using the same low- and high-level image metrics used in the paper.

- Set ``recon_path`` to the name of the file in "fMRI-reconstruction-NSD/src" that was output from ``Reconstructions.py`` (should be ```{model_name}_recons_img2img{img2img_strength}_{recons_per_sample}samples.pt```). 
- Alternatively, to evaluate LAION-5B retrievals, you can replace recon_path with the name of the .pt file output from ```Retrievals.py``` (should be ```{model_name}_laion_retrievals_top16.pt```).
- Set ``all_images_path`` to the all_images.pt file in "fMRI-reconstruction-NSD/src" that was output from either ``Reconstructions.py`` or ``Retrievals.py`` (should be ```all_images.pt```). 

```bash
$ python Reconstruction_Metrics.py --help
```
```
usage: Reconstruction_Metrics.py [-h] [--recon_path RECON_PATH]
                                 [--all_images_path ALL_IMAGES_PATH]

```
